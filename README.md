There are many tools for creating data visualizations, but one of the most common used and powerful is Power BI.

In the previous edition (https://youtu.be/VL67faFn22s?t=14562) we learned how to create effective visualizations in Power BI to display   insights existing on data, showing information extracted from logs recorded in App Insights of an API hosted in Azure.
